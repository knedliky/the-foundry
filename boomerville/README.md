# Boomerville: An Australian House Price Prediction Project

At some point in my life, I want to buy a house in Australia. I don't know where or when this might be possible, so I want to know that I can find the best value houses when they come up on the market in each of the major Australian cities. This is a personal project.

## Introduction

In this project, I will train a machine learning model that will predict the value of a house with the information I have available from publicly available data sources, so I know the value of a house and whether the house is under or over valued. I will know when I am successful, when I can show with confidence that the model is performing consistently over an extended period of time in different market conditions.

A secondary aspect to this project will be the ability to predict the value of a home given a set of features provided to the model in an interactive app, where I might know that I want a two bedroom terrace with 120 metres squared of floor space in Bronte. With this information, I'll also be able to tell where the market might be going, and justify spending a million dollars on an appreciating asset.
