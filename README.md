# The Foundry: Data Science Portfolio

This is a repository containing data science projects I have completed over the years as an avid self learner, a masters of analytics and data science university student and a professional consultant kin the business intelligence and data science space.

For deployments of some of these projects, I will have a website up shortly for your perusal.

## Installation

I personally like to use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), a virtual environment solution that combines functionality of pip, python (using another recommendation [pyenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)) and virtualenv in a simple set up. For the OG's out there and those learning - virtualenv is also fine.

1. Install dependencies from the frozen `requirements.txt` files.
2. Run notebooks the notebook server or coding environment of your choosing.
3. Some of the more complex implementations may require the utilisation of `docker`, I will provide clear instructions when this is the case.

## Contents

### Data Analytics and Visualisation

- __Supermarket Wars__: An exercise in web scraping and hypothesis testing, understanding which Australian supermarkets in which areas are the most expensive, and if the results are significant.
- __Mushrooms__: An exercise in exploratory data analysis and classification, identifying edible and inedible mushrooms. [Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom)
- __Tennis__: An exercise in web scraping and exploratory data analysis using ATP and WTA match data.
- __Avila__: An exercise in clustering, leveraging KMeans  and DBSCAN to analyse data from 800 images extracted from the Avila Bible. The prediction task involves associating a copyist to data observations. [Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/459/avila).
- __Credit Screening__: An exercise in classification, where individuals did or did not receive credit. [Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/28/japanese+credit+screening)
- __NBA__: Exploratory Data Analysis in player statistics.

### Machine Learning

- __Regression: Boomerville__: Predicting house prices in Australia based on economic data
- __Spatial Classification: Good Crop, Bad Crop__: Identifying areas in sugarcane fields that are at risk of producing a poor yield.
- __Reinforcement Learning: Neural Chess__: Building a chess engine using React.js
- __Recommendation Engine: Forty Five__: That's how many hours on average a year a consumer spends deciding on what to watch on TV. An exercise in implementing a paper on collaborative filtering.

### NLP

- __Spotify Rapt__: A model that uses an LLM to provide a written character reference.

### Micro Projects

- __Spotify Rapt__: An app that uses the music and podcasts that you listened to over the year and the LLM model trained earlier to conversationally roast your poor taste in music.
- __Spatial Classification: Good Crop, Bad Crop__: A mapping application that shows areas in sugarcane fields that are at risk of producing a poor yield.
- __Regression: Boomerville__: A dashboard allowing a user to search for their own property, or a property they have seen listed to get an idea of the price it might sell for.
- __Reinforcement Learning: Neural Chess__: A chess engine react app that you can play against.
